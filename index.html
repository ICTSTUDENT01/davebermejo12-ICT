          <h2>Have You Ever Measured Something Without Realizing It?</h2>
          <p>
            Think about it: how many siblings do you have? How tall are you right now? Even in everyday life, we're constantly using numbers —
            whether it's counting steps, measuring time, or checking our height. These numbers are examples of something researchers call <strong>variables</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the world of <strong>quantitative research</strong>, variables are the foundation of any study. They are the values researchers measure, compare, and analyze to understand trends, behaviors, and relationships. But not all variables behave the same — some are fixed and countable, while others flow within a range.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this blog, you’ll learn about the two major types of variables based on how their values behave: <strong>discrete</strong> and <strong>continuous</strong>. By the end, you’ll be able to tell them apart easily — and understand how they’re used in real research.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- DISCRETE VARIABLE -->
        <section class="card">
          <h2>Discrete Variable</h2>

          <p><strong>Description:</strong> A <strong>discrete variable</strong> is one that can only take whole number values. These values are fixed, distinct, and countable — such as the number of books read or the number of siblings a person has.</p>

          <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Countable values</li>
            <li>Whole numbers only (no decimals or fractions)</li>
            <li>Values occur in gaps (e.g., 0, 1, 2...)</li>
            <li>Often finite or limited range of outcomes</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Usage & Purpose in Research:</strong> Discrete variables are useful in studies that involve exact counts or categories. They help researchers measure frequency, compare quantities, and identify patterns in groups or populations. For example, a researcher might study how the number of siblings affects student performance.</p>

          <p><strong>Data Collection/Methodology:</strong> These variables are usually collected through surveys, checklists, questionnaires, and simple observations — asking "How many?" rather than "How much?". They're often analyzed using frequency tables, bar graphs, and pie charts.</p>

          <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
          <div class="image-box">
            <img src="siblings.jpg" alt="Example of Discrete Variable – Number of Siblings"/>
            <p class="caption"><strong>Visual Example: Number of Siblings</strong></p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The image above shows different individuals and how many siblings they have — such as 0, 1, or 3. You can count them, and no partial values exist (like 2.5 siblings). This makes it a perfect example of a discrete variable.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- CONTINUOUS VARIABLE -->
        <section class="card">
          <h2>Continuous Variable</h2>

          <p><strong>Description:</strong> A <strong>continuous variable</strong> is one that can take any value within a given range. These values are measurable, often include decimals or fractions, and can become more precise depending on how they're measured.</p>

          <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Measurable values with infinite possibilities</li>
            <li>Includes decimals and fractions</li>
            <li>Can change gradually and precisely</li>
            <li>No clear gaps between values</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Usage & Purpose in Research:</strong> Continuous variables are used in research that involves detailed measurements — such as physical attributes, time intervals, or environmental data. They allow researchers to analyze trends, fluctuations, and averages over time or space.</p>

          <p><strong>Data Collection/Methodology:</strong> Continuous variables are gathered using measuring tools like rulers, thermometers, timers, or digital instruments. They're analyzed using statistical averages, histograms, line graphs, and scatter plots to observe detailed variations.</p>

          <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
          <div class="image-box">
            <img src="height.jpg" alt="Example of Continuous Variable – Height"/>
            <p class="caption"><strong>Visual Example: A Person's Height</strong></p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The image shows various heights — such as 160.2 cm or 172.75 cm. These values can have many decimals and vary precisely. That’s why height is considered a continuous variable — it can be measured as accurately as needed, with no limit to in-between values.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- CONCLUSION -->
        <section class="summary">
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            In quantitative research, recognizing the type of variable you're working with — whether discrete or continuous — is essential for accurate data collection, analysis, and interpretation. Discrete variables focus on exact counts, while continuous variables deal with precise measurements.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a student or researcher, this knowledge helps you choose the right tools, ask the right questions, and represent your data correctly. Whether you’re counting people or measuring height — you’re using the power of variables to understand the world better.
